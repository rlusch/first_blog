<p>Blogging. Certainly, this is something that many have aspired to. Many have done, poorly. Many more will also continue to do it poorly.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I am one of those that has aspired to try my hand at blogging. It almost seems like it might bring the nostalgic practice of journaling into the modern age. At least that’s how I feel about it now.</p>
<p>You might ask, “If you’ve aspired to this, what has taken so long, and why now?”</p>
<p>My honest answer is, I don’t know why it has taken so long for me to try my hand at it. Perhaps the thought of starting something like this as a little daunting. Perhaps I know that I lack the ability to dedicate time to something that I don’t have a passion for, and I didn’t know whether I would have a passion for this sort of thing or not. Maybe, it is something that got washed away in the tide of the ever churning ‘newness’ of the next thing. Maybe it’s none of these.</p>
<p>In the here and now, I can say I am starting this as a means of preparing for a class. I am going to be taking a Marketing class for Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) and the syllabus said we are going to have four blog posts due for the class. The professor pointed toward Wordpress; I knew, however, that R had a package for handling blogging, so I decided to give that a chance and see how difficult it would be to set up and maintain. Simultaneously, I’d create a blog to be able to share with my professor to get approval to use this workstream instead of WordPress.</p>
<p>I just got the idea to use this method to start the blog a little over four hours ago. In that time I had a meeting for my bowling league (maybe another blogging opportunity?!), ate dinner, and drove nearly an hour. Yet here I am composing my first blog via R and blogdown. It is really amazing what you can do when you stand on the shoulders of giants. So with that in mind I’d like to thank Yihue Xie for creating the packages necessary for this and producing such a great resource as his book on <blogdown><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>.</p>
<p>So, would I say that this service could be useful for begginners? If you are familiar with R and Rmarkdown, <em>Yes</em>; otherwise <em>No</em>. There is a fair amount of stuff to learn about in order to get full customization. Though, Yihue was thoughtful enough with his initial coding and walkthrough to put everything in place where you can have a working blog in a very short amount of time. However, I can say for certain that you very quickly want to start putting your own flare in the final results. Luckily for me, I’ll be able to focus on the blog and customization because I already have a familiarty with the system I am doing this through. It would be hard for me to imagine trying to learn <strong>all</strong> of this simulaneously.</p>
<p>I will follow up in my next blog with some more details around the process and some of the things I needed to do in order to customize my blog a little more like I want it.</p>
